## Interfaces

1. A set of method signatures.
2. Interfaces are implemented implicitly.
3. A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.
4. Implicit interfaces decouple the definition of an interface from its implementation, which could then appear in any package without prearrangement.
5. Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an object: if something can do this, then it can be used here.
6. Interfaces are types that just declare behavior.
