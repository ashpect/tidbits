//In this example, the openDirectories function opens a directory without closing it inside a loop that iterates 100,000 times.
//However, there is no corresponding dir.Close() call to close the directories.
//If you run this code, it will rapidly consume system resources, such as file handles, as the loop opens a large number of directories without releasing them.
// Eventually, the system may reach its resource limits, causing resource exhaustion,
//and potentially leading to a denial of service scenario where the system becomes unresponsive or other processes are unable to open directories due to the lack of available resources.
//To avoid such exploitation and ensure proper resource management, it is important to close opened directories using defer dir.Close() or by explicitly calling dir.Close() at the appropriate place in your code when you no longer need them.
